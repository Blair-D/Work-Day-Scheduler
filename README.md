# Work-Day-Scheduler
Deployed Application: https://blair-d.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

#DESCRIPTION The motivation behind this project was to improve a work day scheduler. The improvements made were to enable the user to add appointments and then have the ability to store those new appointments in local storage. Also, visually the page was updated so the user knows exactly what time block they are currnetly in with past, present, and future hour block being color coordinated with real live time. This have been a learning experience on how JQuery and API's can add additional benifits for the user.
